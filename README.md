# SteganoProject
 Internship project

This is a project of Steganography in which you encrypt a secret message in an image using a secret key and then decrypt the encrypted image using the secret to read the secret message. 

>>PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project focuses on secure data hiding using bit manipulation of the pixels in the images, the message is being converted to an ASCII value and then encrypted into the images pixelâ€™s LSB bit. So the encrypted image isnâ€™t distorted and identified that it is a stego image. Then the encrypted image is decrypted to get the secret message.  

>>TECHNOLOGY USED 
Libraries used are :-
 a). OpenCV
 b). Os 
 c). Stegano
Programming languages used are :-
a). Python 
Tools and Platforms used are :-
a). Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm / VS Code 
b). Github / Gitlab


>> WOW FACTORS
 1). Not just hiding data, but securing it with encryption
 2). Supports multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP)
 3).High capacity with minimal image distortion
 4).User-friendly GUI/Web-based access
 5).Anti-detection features to resist steganalysis

>>END USERS
Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics Experts 
Government & Intelligence Agencies 
Journalists & Whistleblowers 
Military & Defense Organizations
Everyday Internet Users
Researchers & Academics
Corporate & Business Professionals 

>>CONCLUSION 
This project ensures secure, undetectable data hiding using encryption (AES-256) and advanced steganography (LSB, DCT, DWT). It enhances privacy and security for cybersecurity, intelligence, and journalism. Future upgrades may include AI and blockchain integration for improved protection.

>>FUTURE SCOPE
